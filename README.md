# nodejs-starter-project

Author - Vaibhav Bhavsar

Just the right number of packages to get started with the most common nodejs projects - ToDos, CRUDs, E-Commerce - anything that requires you to work with 
1. Express 
2. MongoDB 
3. JWT Authentication
This saves about 20 minutes starting time to install and check the right set of dependencies that work well together :)

- Also has nodemon for working in development.
- Also has a docker file - which is generic enough to be used for more than 90% nodeJS projects
- Also has the right project structure that can be used for more than 90% of NodeJS projects :)
- Also has the "right" gitignore file that you will need

Don't work from scratch guys!

Fork this and use it and drop a star here bruh!
